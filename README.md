# PYTHON CLIENT-SERVER 
This is a simple implementation of a server that handles requests from multiple clients.


---
## DESCRIPTION
This basic application is a client-server python chat room implemented over HTTP. 
The server is able to listen to multiple requests and forward communication to each client.
The clients can also communicate with each other over the server.

## RUNNING THE SERVER

Open the command prompt/shell and change the file directory to where the script sits.
Run the server by: python server.py.
Run the client by: python client.py. (you can run multiple clients by opening more cmd prompt windows)
